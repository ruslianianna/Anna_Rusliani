                    <h2>Favorite Destination in Poso is SALOUPA Waterfall</h2>
					<p> For those of you who live in Central Sulawesi Province or are visiting this area, it feels incomplete if you haven't visited one of these natural tourist destinations, namely the Salopa Poso waterfall.
						This waterfall is commonly called by the local community as Saluopa waterfall which means a source of clear spring water from the mountains that flows rapidly from the top of the mountain. Salopa Poso waterfall is one of the mainstay tourist attractions located in Tonusu Village, North Pamona District, Poso Regency which is about 264 km from Palu City. You can travel to this location using a private vehicle with an entrance ticket and parking fee for four-wheeled vehicles of IDR 5,000.
						
						Visitors who want to visit this place are advised to come around 9:00 WITA to avoid the air being too cold. When arriving at the location, visitors must walk about 500 meters through the forest to get to the waterfall location. During the trip, our eyes will be spoiled with views of dense and tall trees and the beautiful tropical forest atmosphere.
						
						Not only the freshness of the water and air around the waterfall location, this tour also presents beautiful natural scenery with the characteristic of 12 levels of waterfalls. Visitors can climb each level of the waterfall via stairs to enjoy the beauty of each level. In addition, visitors can also use this tourist location to take pictures together, play in the water, and even soak.
						
						For visitors who want to picnic with their families, they can also bring provisions to eat on the spot or buy food at stalls around the location while still paying attention to cleanliness and preserving the environment.
						
						For those of you who like to travel, there's nothing wrong with visiting this location while supporting the Government's program in restoring the local economy and buying UMKM products. Happy traveling.
